Description: The Shiny codebase for eyeIntegration.nei.nih.gov. The package does 
    not contain the three sqlite databases holding the bulk RNA-seq, single cell 
    RNA-seq, and WGCNA networks that underlie eyeIntegration. There is a helper 
    script given that downloads and decompresses these data.
